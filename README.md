# Cypress

Used for website testing. [Cypress in a nutshell](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell)

## Tutorial

Follow the [Add a test](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html#Add-a-test-file) tutorial on Cypress.

Check it out by running:

```js
npm run start
```

It will run both cypress and the app. 
If you want just the web app:

```js
npm run app
```

### Set up a simple web app

For that I used [express](https://expressjs.com/) which is a node web server.
You can follow this tutorial to get [started](https://expressjs.com/fr/starter/hello-world.html).

### Tips

- Run two web app concurrently with node answer on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35455532/7747942)
